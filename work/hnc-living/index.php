      <p>What do you do when your nonprofit has successfully helped more than 1,200 head and neck cancer patients with their treatment and recovery, but you’re ready to expand beyond your local roots?</p>
      <p class="mb-4" style="z-index:99">For <a href="https://www.hncliving.org">HNC Living Foundation</a>, the answer was a new website designed to expand their reach, attract more donors, and &#8211; most importantly &#8211; reach more patients to help them conquer the burdens related to their treatment and recovery.</p>

Kyle clearly identified objectives and planned an approach we could follow and participate in that didn’t disrupt our normal activities. Our finished product came in on-time, on-budget, and on-target. We will most definitely continue to rely on Kyle and flow14 to keep our web presence current and designed to enhance our brand and identity.”</p>
