				<h1>Lisa Johnston for U.S. Senate</h1>
				<p><strong>The Story.</strong> In April 2010, my wife announced her candidacy for U.S. Senate, beginning a whirlwind 7+ months of campaigning and traveling all over Kansas. Her campaign gave me the opportunity to create a distinctive brand and design a host of campaign materials on tight timelines and a shoestring budget.</p>
				<p><strong>The Services.</strong> Logo Design, Printed Materials, Printed Ads, Web Presence, TV Spots</p>

					<h2>Logo Design</h2>
						<p>The campaign logo had to function in a variety of layouts and have the flexibility to work on everything from full color business cards to 1-color parade banners, so I incorporated elements that could be rearranged to work in any format while maintaining a unique, easily recognizable look.</p>
						<p>Given she was the only female Senate candidate, I decided to make her first name the strongest element â€” it's easy to read, easy to remember and helped her stand apart from other candidates.</p>

						<h2>Printed Materials</h2>
						<p>We started the campaign with donation envelopes and business cards; as the campaign progressed I designed a wide range of materials, including yard signs, direct mail, walk cards, banners, magnets, stickers and more.</p>
						<p>As we traveled across the state, I incorporated photos from campaign stops into walk cards and mailers, ensuring each piece had a fresh look while maintaining an overall visual consistency.</p>

						<h2>Ads</h2>
						<p>We ran campaign ads in several newspapers and local event brochures, and I designed the ads to look dramatically different than typical candidate ads.</p>

						<h2>TV Spots</h2>
						<p>Like the print ads, Lisa's TV spots were written and directed to stand apart from typical campaign spots and introduce Lisa to the voters of Kansas. They all featured Lisa looking directly into the camera, sharing her positions with the viewers.</p>
